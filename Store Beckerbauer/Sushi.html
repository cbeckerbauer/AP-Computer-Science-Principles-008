				<p>Looking at these two (of many) definitions of <span><a href = "https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sushi" class = "sushiLinks">sushi</a></span>, if nothing else we gather that sushi is, first and foremost, about the rice, 
					<span id = "subHeadingOneItalics">not</span> raw fish, as many Westerners assume. That's not to say that there isn't a fair amount of sushi containing raw fish. 
						Sushi chefs will tell you that it takes a lifetime to perfect the art of sushi-making, because it takes a lifetime to perfect the 
							preparation of sushi rice. </p>
